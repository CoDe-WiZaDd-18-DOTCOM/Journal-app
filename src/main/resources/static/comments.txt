lombok (@Data) used for setters and getters with extra arg constructors
we have to define @NoArgsConstructor if we want that it is a pain in ass

we added journalEntries and controller services and repository for that
we added User, and similarly we added controller services and repository for this too.

remember repository should be "Interface" and should extend "MongoRepository<Class , @Id>""

we defined special methods if it's not there in Repository in Mongo Extended Class

we used "ResponseEntity" for special type of "return codes" in client side like "200","404", "201" like that

connected database in "application.properties"

added "dependency" in "pom.xml" for "MongoDB", "Lombok" and loaded Maven

if we want to run this in terminal we should first update it by MVN like "mvn -U clean install" in pom.xml directory
after updating it we should run "mvn spring-boot:run"


the build files go to target directory

we are using "Transaction" like if we add a journal and it updated in Journal entry but failed in User JournalEntries
it creates a problem so we use Transaction for that


"PlatformTransactionManager","MongoDatabaseFactory","MongoTransactionManager"  defined for transaction purposes in main file
